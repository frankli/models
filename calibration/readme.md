Models for testing printer precision. 

10x20 blocks

The 2 parts are designed to have 0.1mm tolerance, they should fit loosely with each other if your printer is printing the correct size. 

They are meant to be printed flat on the print bed, in order to test the "elephant foot" effect. The hollow ones are for resin printers (to saving resin and easy to remove from bed) and the solid ones are for fdm.
