Models for testing printer precision. 

10x20 blocks

The 2 parts are designed to have 0.1mm tolerance, they should fit loosely with each other if your printer is printing the correct size. 

They are meant to be printed flat on the print bed, in order to test the "elephant foot" effect. The hollow ones are for resin printers (to saving resin and easy to remove from bed) and the solid ones are for fdm. 

m6 bold & nut

These might be the ultimate test for precision. Print the parts and see if they screw together. You can then find yourself real m6 screws and nuts and see if the printed parts fit with real ones.
